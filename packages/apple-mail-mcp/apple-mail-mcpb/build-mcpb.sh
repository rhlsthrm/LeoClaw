Configure preferences in Claude Desktop settings under this MCP to customize behavior:

- Frequently used folders

**MCP Configuration:**
No additional configuration required! Uses your Apple Mail accounts.

## Permissions

On first run, macOS will prompt for permissions:
- **Mail.app Control**: Required to automate Mail
- **Mail Data Access**: Required to read email content

Grant these permissions for full functionality.

## Usage Examples

Ask Claude:
- "Show me all unread emails in my Gmail account"
- "Search for emails about 'project update' in my work account"
- "Move emails with 'meeting' in the subject to my Archive folder"
- "Reply to the email about 'Domain name' with 'Thanks for the update!'"

- "What folders do I have in my work account?"

## Requirements

- macOS with Apple Mail configured
- Python 3.7+
- Mail app with at least one account configured
- Appropriate macOS permissions granted

## Notes

- Email operations require Mail.app to be running
- Some operations (like fetching content) may be slower than metadata-only operations
- Exchange accounts may have different mailbox structures
- Moving and replying to emails includes safety limits
- Email sending is immediate - use with caution
